            <p class="answer">
                Welcome to Liquid Logic! In this project, we have collected data from various sources and have made them visually
                appealing for students. This project mainly focuses the students who are still in school (K12). Here, we have 
                created a simple webpage which helps students better understand the availability of freshwater sources, their importance,
                and how they are being scarce day by day. In the end, we have made a solution for global, local and personal level.

                <p class="question"  id="q2" >Water on Earth</p> 
            <p class="answer">
                About <strong>71%</strong> of total volume of Earth is covered in water, which is about 370 quintillion (370,000,000,000,000,000,000)  gallons of water. 
                <p>In the vast mass of water, 96.5% of the total water is contained in the oceans, 1.7% in ice-caps, another 1.7% contained in rivers, lakes, streams and other water sources, and 0.001% in Water Vapour.</p>
                <div class="div1">The visual tool below shows the water distribution on earth.</div></p>
                <img src="where_is_earth_water.png" class="image_1" alt="Water Image">
            <p class="answer">
                But, among the water we have, 0.01% of total is only fresh(clean and drinkable) water. In today's age, many people are facing water crisis, which simply means shortage of water.
                 Day by day, fresh water sources are getting harder to find due to it's shortage. If there is shortage of water, many 
                 people will become dehydrated(Shortage of water in their body). This is a bad thing, as even our body is made up of water. 
                 Due to climate change, natural water cycle process of earth is affected which results in water shortage. </p>

        <div class="water_cycle"><p class="question" id="q3" > Water Cycle</p> 
            <p class="answer">
                Water in, its liquid form evaporates, into the air. These water molecules move up along air currents known as "thermals" (the same air currents that help birds to fly) until they come together with other water molecules, forming a cloud.
                 When the cloud becomes dense enough, the now bonded water molecules become too heavy for the air to hold it up, and the water falls creating rain. Rain goes back into the ground/rivers/ponds/oceans and the cycle starts again.
            </p>
            <div class="div2"><img src="water_cycle.png" alt="Water Cycle"></div>
        <div class="process_in_cycle">
            <p>Different process involved in water cycle are:</p>
        <p><b><i>1. Evaporation:</i></b></p>
        <p>Evaporation is the process by which water changes into water vapour. 
            This can be considered as the first step of cycle as water from different source like Rivers, ocean, lake etc. get evaporated and go to atmosphere. </p>
        <p>water also goes to atmosphere from plants by the process of transpiration. In transpiration, water molecules are removed from aerial parts of plants.</p>
        <p><b><i>2. Condensation:</i></b></p>
        <p> In  this process, the evaporated water molecules again turn into liquid water. 
            This happens when air gets cooled to dew point. During this process Hailstone and Snow are also formed.</p>
        <p><b><i>3. Precipitation:</i></b></p>
        <p> After condensation, water is now released in the form of rain, snow, hailstone, sleet. This is called precipitation.</p>
        <p><b><i>4. Collection:</i></b></p>
        <p>The precipitated water is collected in rivers, lakes, streams, as snow in mountains and as underground water. </p>
        <p><b><i>5. Runoff:</i></b></p>
        <p>Runoff is the follow of water from greater heights to lower during rainfall or due to melting of ice when excess water cannot be absorbed by ground. 
            Most of the runoff water gets collected in river and lakes, which returns to ocean while some of the water evaporates again.</p>
        <p><b><i>6. Interception:</i></b></p>
        <p>It is the containment of water by vegetation and soil which get absorbed by vegetation or get evaporated again. </p>
        <p><b><i>7. Infiltration:</i></b></p>
        <p>In this process water is absorbed or soaked into soil which results in underground water. 
            If water follow through the soil and porous or fractured rocks it is called percolation</p>
        <p><b><i>8. Discharge:</i></b></p>
        <p>The groundwater exits into rivers, lakes, streams or directly to ocean, and this process is called discharge.</p>

            <p class="question" id="q4" > Climate Change </p>
            <p class="answer">
                Climate change refers to change in average weather condition of a place for a long time (may take several decades).
                But, how does climate change occur? Well, to put it simply, when people burn almost anything, it releases a gas called Carbon Dioxide into the atmosphere, as almost everything Organic we see today is made up of Carbon. 
                When Carbon Dioxide increases, it causes the Greenhouse Effect (The light stays around the atmosphere a bit longer and the environment gets more chance to absorb heat from it).
                This causes the atmosphere to heat up even more, causing the climate to change over time.</p>
                <img src="greenhouse-effect-diagram.jpg" alt="Greenhouse effect">
            <p class="answer">
                For example, due to increase in temperature, water evaporation increases. This increases the melting of ice-caps which significantly affects the water cycle. 
                Now, we will study the effects in water cycle in detail.</p>
            <p class="answer">  
                As carbon dioxide increases in atmosphere, it absorbs more heat energy and releases less amount than it absorbs due to which temperature increases. 
                According to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) CO2 in our current atmosphere is about 420 ppb(parts per billion). 
                which is continuously increasing since 1955. As the observation of NOAA CO2 has increased by 50% i.e. it is 150% CO2 today than that at 1750 A.D.</p>

        <p class="question" id="q5">Temperature</p>

        <p>Temperature is simply the degree of hotness or coldness of a body.
            Whenever you are sick, you have the doctor take something and put it in your mouth. This is called the Thermometer.
            The Thermometer measures the temperature of any body.
            As Temperature is a term used for any body, even planets like Earth have a temperature.
        </p>

        <p class="answer">Temperature of earth has increased by 1 degree Fahrenheit in last 100 years,
                which seems very less but even a small change in temperature can have significant effect in our ecosystem.
                Since preindustrial age, temperature of earth has increased by 1.1 degree Centigrade.</p>
        <img src="temperature_photo.png" class="image_1" alt="Plotting of temperature">
        <p>The above graph shows change in global surface temperature compared to long-term average from 1951 to 1980.
             The year 2020 titled with 2016 for the hottest year since the data was recorded.
            What does it mean? Well, it simply means that in the future, your Summers will be twice as hot and your Winters will be as hot as your Summers.
            This is a bad thing, as Summers are already hot enough. This also creates other problems.
            </p>

        <p>Due to increase in global temperature, ice-sheets are decreasing day by day and on the other hand, ocean warming keeps on increasing.
             According to ice mass measured by NASA's GRACE satellite, ice mass in Antarctica is decreasing by 146 billion metric tonnes per
              year and that in Greenland is 270 billion metric tonnes per year since 2002.</p>

        <video width="800" height="400" autoplay loop id="my_video"><source src="earth-rotation-graph-thingy.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

        <p>As the ice melts due to global warming, sea level increases.
            A small change in sea level can affect the water resources in coastal region significantly. 
            According to satellite sea level observation sea level has increased by 98mm( nearly 1 inch) since 1993.</p>
            <video width="800" height="400" autoplay loop id = "my_video_3"><source src="sea-level-variation.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
           

        <p>Ninety percent of total global warming occurs in ocean which causes increase in internal heat of water.
             According to NOAA, ocean heat has increased by 345 Zettajoules(345*10^21) since 1955.</p>

            <img src="zetta_joules_temperature.png" class="image_1" alt ="Temperature heat">
        <p>From these data of observations, we know the effects of climate change in environment and water resources. But how is Earth's water cycle affected by Climate change?
            Due to the increase in temperature, the rate of evaporation increases. This can cause the small water resources like lakes, ponds, small rivers to dry and also change the rain pattern, as we learned previously that 
            rain occurs due to Lakes and Rivers.
            There is also decrease in underground water level. This causes change in precipitation(Falling of Rain, Snow, or anything from the sky) which results in  more rainfall
            in some places and no rain in other places. It disturbs the timing and distribution of water resources, 
            which ultimately affect the natural water cycle. Drought(No rain) and drying of water resources lead to scarcity in water, which is termed 'Water crisis'.
            Ice-caps are one of the major sources of fresh water. But, due to melting of ice-caps and snow in a very large amount, there will be water crisis in dry seasons.
            This also causes rise in sea level in other places.
            Due to the increased sea level, salt water mixes with fresh water sources in coastal regions. This makes the water unfit for drinking and irrigation, as there is too much salt.
            <img src="salinity.png" class="image_2" alt="Salinity">
            The increase in sea-level is also a major cause for Huge Tsunamis and floods, and even sinking of some islands.
            Temperature difference between places due to climate change can also change the wind pattern, resulting in cyclones and hurricanes.
            </p>


        <p class="question" id="q6" > Agriculture </p>
        
        <p class="answer">Agriculture sector is the major user of fresh water. About 70% of total fresh water withdrawals goes to agriculture.
            But most of the water irrigated is not used by crops. Large volume evaporates to atmosphere, some amount of water get infiltrated and remaining is absorbed by plants.
            Also the maximum water absorbed by plants  also goes to atmosphere by transpiration. so, if there agriculture in large area it can affect the fresh water resources near it. 
            It greatly effect underground water as plants absorb water in large amount and the water is sent to atmosphere by transpiration process. </p>

            <p>Also the insecticides and pesticides used in the agriculture also affect water resources near it.
            Pesticides often contain chemicals designed to kill or control pests, but they can be carried away
            by rainwater, irrigation, or runoff from fields into nearby water bodies like rivers, lakes, and groundwater. 
            This runoff, known as pesticide leaching, can introduce harmful chemicals into aquatic ecosystems.</p>

            <p><i><b>1. Harm to Aquatic Life</b></i></p>
            <p>Pesticides can be toxic to aquatic organisms, disrupting ecosystems and reducing biodiversity. 
                Fish, insects, and other aquatic species can suffer from direct exposure to these chemicals.</p>
            
            <p><i><b>2. Contamination of Drinking Water</b></i></p>
            <p> Pesticides that reach groundwater sources can contaminate drinking water supplies, posing health risks to humans. 
                Even low levels of pesticide residues in drinking water can be a cause for concern.</p>

            <p><i><b>3. Ecological Disruption</b></i></p>
            <p>Pesticide pollution can disrupt the balance of ecosystems by 
                affecting the food chain and harming non-target species, which can lead to long-term ecological imbalances.</p>
                <img src="after_industry.jpg" alt="Image to put after industry" class="image_1">


            
            <p class="question" id="q7"> Industry </p>
            <p class="answer">Industry is also one of the major user of fresh water, every industry
                 use water in large amount for fabricating, processing, cooling, washing, diluting, etc. 
                 As one of the  major user, industry is also the major pollutant of water resources.
                 The solid waste and harmful liquid chemical waste that comes from industry which is directly
                  mixed to rivers and other water resource  cause water pollution and make the water unfit to 
                  use. It also affect underground water. </p>

                  <img src="industry_and_agriculture_and_water.jpg" alt="Relation between Industry, Agriculture and Water" class="image_1">

                <p>Industrial activities contribute significantly to water pollution through factors such as:</p>
                <p><b><i>1. Chemical Discharges</i></b></p>
                <p>Many industries release toxic chemicals and pollutants into water sources, leading to contamination.
                     For example, chemical plants may discharge harmful substances into nearby rivers.</p>
                <p><b><i>2. Runoff</i></b></p>
                <p>Rainwater can wash pollutants from industrial sites into waterways, carrying oil, sediment, and other contaminants.</p>
                <p><b><i>3. Wastewater</i></b></p>
                <p>Properly treated industrial wastewater can contain pollutants that harm aquatic life and disrupt ecosystems.</p>
                <p><b><i>4. Agricultural Runoff</i></b></p>
                <p>The use of fertilizers and pesticides in agriculture can lead to water pollution when they wash into rivers and streams.</p>
                <p><b><i>5. Mining Activities</i></b></p>
                <p>Mining operations can release heavy metals and other toxins into water sources, affecting both aquatic systems and human health.</p>

               <p class="question" id="q8">The Solution</p>

               <p>What should we do to solve the problem? <br>
                Since the main factor creating problem in water cycle is climate change. Our prime concern will be mitigating climate change in local level as well as global level as far as possible. <br>
                1. We should use solar energy, hydro electricity and other renewable resources instead of fossil fuels and firewood for domestic purpose. <br>
                2. We should focus on organic farming, without use of chemical fertilizer and managed irrigation. <br>
                3. We should promote afforestation, it can control pollution and protect  water resources. <br>
                4. We should move to Electric vehicle (EVs) for transportation, which will decrease air pollution and climate change in large scale. <br>
                5. Industrial waste should not be directly mixed to water resources And industries should be focused use solar and eco-friendly energy like hydropower instead of fossil fuels.</p>
