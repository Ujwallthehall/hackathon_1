                <p class="question"  id="q2" >Water on Earth</p> 
            <p class="answer">
                About <strong>71%</strong> of total volume of Earth is covered in water, which is about <mark>370 quintillion (370,000,000,000,000,000,000)</mark>  gallons of water. 
                <p>In the vast mass of water, <mark>97.3%</mark> of the total water is contained in the oceans, <mark>2%</mark> in ice-caps, <mark>0.68%</mark> as underground water and <mark>0.0001%</mark> is contained in rivers, lakes, streams and other water sources.</p>

            <p class="answer">
                But only 0.01% of total is only fresh water. In today date large volume of population is facing water crisis problem. Day by day fresh water sources are getting affect by climate change and water is becoming scarce.
                 Due to climate change natural water cycle process of earth is affected which results water scarcity. </p>

        <div class="water_cycle"><p class="question" id="q3" > Water Cycle</p> 
            <p class="answer">
                Water Cycle refers to the continuous process of movement of water within the earth and atmosphere through various complex processes. Sun plays the most important role in this cycle. 
            The water in Earth evaporates into water vapour and condenses in atmosphere to form cloud and precipitate again in the form of rain, snow, hailstone, sleet etc</p>
            <div class="div2"><img src="water_cycle.png" alt="Water Cycle"></div>

        <div class="process_in_cycle">
            <p>Different process involved in water cycle are:</p>
        <p><b><i>1. Evaporation:</i></b></p>
        <p>Evaporation is the process by which water changes into water vapour. 
            This can be considered as the first step of cycle as water from different source like Rivers, ocean, lake etc. get evaporated and go to atmosphere. </p>
        <p>water also goes to atmosphere from plants by the process of <span style="color: red;">transpiration</span>. In transpiration, water molecules are removed from aerial parts of plants.</p>
        <p><b><i>2. Condensation:</i></b></p>
        <p> In  this process, the evaporated water molecules again turn into liquid water. 
            This happens when air gets cooled to <span style="color: red;">dew point</span>. During this process Hailstone and Snow are also formed.</p>
        <p><b><i>3. Precipitation:</i></b></p>
        <p> After condensation, water is now released in the form of rain, snow, hailstone, sleet. This is called precipitation.</p>
        <p><b><i>4. Collection:</i></b></p>
        <p>The precipitated water is collected in rivers, lakes, streams, as snow in mountains and as underground water. </p>
        <p><b><i>5. Runoff:</i></b></p>
        <p>Runoff is the follow of water from higher altitude to lower during rainfall or due to melting of ice when excess water cannot be absorbed by ground. 
            Most of the runoff water gets collected in river and lakes, which returns to ocean while some of the water evaporates again.</p>
        <p><b><i>6. Interception:</i></b></p>
        <p>It is the retention of water by vegetation and soil which get absorbed by vegetation or get evaporated again. </p>
        <p><b><i>7. Infiltration:</i></b></p>
        <p>In this process water is absorbed or soaked into soil which results in underground water. 
            If water follow through the soil and porous or fractured rocks it is called <span style="color: red;">percolation</span></p>
        <p><b><i>8. Discharge:</i></b></p>
        <p>The groundwater exits into rivers, lakes, streams or directly to ocean, and this process is called discharge.</p>

            <p class="question" id="q4" > Climate Change </p>
            <p class="answer">
                Climate change refers to change in average weather condition of a place for a long time (may take several decades).
                 The main reason of climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, CFCs, sulphur dioxide, for which everyone of us are responsible. 
                 And climate change has affected almost all the natural cycles in Earth like water cycle, carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle etc.</p>
            <p class="answer">
                For example, due to increase in temperature, water evaporation increases, melting of ice-caps increases which significantly affects the water cycle. 
                Now, we will study effects in water cycle in detail.</p>
            <p class="answer">  
                As carbon dioxide increases in atmosphere, it absorbs more heat energy and releases less amount than it absorbs due to which temperature increases. 
                According to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (<span style="color: red;">NOAA</span>) CO2 in our atmosphere is about 420 ppb(parts per billion) in today date, 
                which is continuously increasing since 1955. As the observation of NOAA CO2 has increased by 50% i.e. it is 150% CO2 today than that at 1750 A.D.</p>
                
            <p class="answer">
                Geostationary or geosynchronous orbit is the best spot for communications satellites to use, however. This is a zone above Earth's equator at an altitude of 35,786 km (22,236 mi).
                 At this altitude, the rate of "fall" around the Earth is about the same as Earth's rotation, which allows the satellite to stay above the same spot on Earth almost constantly.
                  The satellite thus keeps a perpetual connection with a fixed antenna on the ground, allowing for reliable communications.</p>
                
            <p class="answer">
                While some satellites are best used around the equator, others are better suited to more polar orbits â€”
                 those that circle the Earth from pole to pole so that their coverage zones include the north and south poles. 
                 Examples of polar-orbiting satellites include weather satellites and reconnaissance satellites.</p>

        <p class="question" id="q5">Temperature</p>
        <p class="answer">Temperature of earth has increased by 1 degree Fahrenheit in last 100 years,
                which seems very less but even a small change in temperature can have significant effect in our ecosystem.
                since preindustrial age temperature of earth has increased by 1.1 degree Centigrade.</p>
        <img src="temperature_photo.png" class="image_1" alt="Plotting of temperature">
        <p>The above graph shows change in global surface temperature compared to long-term average from 1951 to 1980.
             The year 2020 titled with 2016 for the hottest year since 1880 A.D.</p>

        <p>Due to increase in global temperature, ice-sheets are decreasing day by day and on the other hand, ocean warming keeps on increasing.
             According to ice mass measured by NASA's GRACE satellite, ice mass in Antarctica is decreasing by 146 billion metric tonnes per
              year and that in Greenland is 270 billion metric tonnes per year since 2002.</p>

        <img src="antartica_mass_ice.png" class="image_2" alt="ice mass graph">

        <p>As the ice melts due to global warming, sea level increases.
            A small change in sea level can affect the water resources in coastal region significantly. 
            According to satellite sea level observation sea level has increased by 98mm( nearly 1 inch) since 1993.</p>
            <div><video width="800" height="400"><source src="sea-level-variation.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
            </div>

        <p>Ninety percent of total global warming occurs in ocean which cause increase in internal heat of water.
             According to NOAA, ocean heat has increased by 345 Zettajoules(345*10^21) since 1955.</p>

            <img src="zetta_joules_temperature.png" class="image_1" alt ="Temperature heat">
        <p>From these data of observations, we knew effects of climate change in environment and water resources. But how Earth's water cycle is actually affected? how these things can leads to water scarcity?...
            Due to increase in temperature rate of evaporation increases, which can lead some small water resources like lakes, ponds, small rivers to dry and also change the rain pattern.
            There is also decrease in underground water level. This leads to altered precipitation which results in  more rainfall in some places and drought in other place. It disturb timing and distribution of water resource, 
            which ultimately affect natural water cycle. And drought and drying of water resources leads to water crisis.
            Ice-caps are one of major source of fresh water due to melting of ice-caps and snow in large amount there will be water crisis in dry seasons. And also rise in sea level. 
            Due to increased sea level salt water mix with fresh water source in coastal region making it unfit for drinking and irrigation.
            Temperature difference between places due to climate change can also change wind pattern.
