            <p class="answer">
                Welcome to Liquid Logic! In this project, we are preparing a visual tool that shows how climate change affects natural water cycle process of earth.</p>

                <p class="question"  id="q2" >Water on Earth</p> 
            <p class="answer">
                About <strong>71%</strong> of total volume of Earth is covered by water, which is about <mark>370 quintillion (370,000,000,000,000,000,000)</mark>  gallons of water. 
                <p>In which 97.3% of total water is contained in ocean, 2% in ice-caps, 0.68% as underground water and 0.0001% is contained in rivers, <br>lakes stream and other sources.</p>
                <div class="div1">The visual tool below shows the water distribution on earth.</div></p>

            <p class="answer">
                But only 0.01% of total is only fresh water. In today date large volume of population is facing water crisis problem. Day by day fresh water sources are getting affect by climate change and water is becoming scarce.
                 Due to climate change natural water cycle process of earth is affected which results water scarcity. </p>

        <div class="water_cycle"><p class="question" id="q3" > Water Cycle</p> 
            <p class="answer">
                Water Cycle refers to the continuous process of movement of water within the earth and atmosphere through different complex process. Sun plays the most important role in this cycle. 
            The water in Earth evaporates into water vapour and condenses in atmosphere to form cloud and precipitate again in the form rain, snow, hailstone, sleet etc</p>
            <div class="div2"><img src="water_cycle.png" alt="Water Cycle"></div>

        <div class="process_in_cycle">
            <p>Different process involved in water cycle are:</p>
        <p><b><i>1. Evaporation:</i></b></p>
        <p>Evaporation is the process by which water changes into water vapour. 
            This can be considered as the first step of cycle as water from different source like Rivers, ocean, lake etc. get evaporated and go to atmosphere. </p>
        <p>water also goes to atmosphere from plants by the process of <span style="color: red;">transpiration</span>. In transpiration water molecule are removed from areal parts of plants.</p>
        <p><b><i>2. Condensation:</i></b></p>
        <p> In  this process the evaporated water molecules again turns into liquid water. 
            This happens    when air get cooled to <span style="color: red;">dew point</span>. During this process Hailstone and snow are also formed.</p>
        <p><b><i>3. Precipitation:</i></b></p>
        <p> After condensation, water is now released in the form of rain, snow, hailstone, sleet. This is called precipitation.</p>
        <p><b><i>4. Collection:</i></b></p>
        <p>The precipitated water is collected in rivers, lakes, streams, as snow in mountains and as underground water. </p>
        <p><b><i>5. Runoff:</i></b></p>
        <p>Runoff is the follow of water from higher altitude to lower during rainfall or due to melting of ice when excess water cannot be absorbed by ground. 
            Most of the runoff water get collected in river and lakes which returns to ocean while some water evaporates again.</p>
        <p><b><i>6. Interception:</i></b></p>
        <p>It is the retention of water by vegetation and soil which get absorbed by vegetation or get evaporated again. </p>
        <p><b><i>7. Infiltration:</i></b></p>
        <p>In this process water is absorbed or soaked into soil which results in underground water. 
            If water follow through the soil and porous or fractured rocks it is called <span style="color: red;">percolation</span></p>
        <p><b><i>8. Discharge:</i></b></p>
        <p>The groundwater exits into rivers, lakes, streams or directly to ocean, this process is called discharge.</p>

            <p class="question" id="q4" > Climate Change </p>
            <p class="answer">
                Climate change refers to change in average weather condition of a place for long time ( several decades).
                 Like a place getting warmer, wetter, drier for long time. 
                 The main reason of climate change is increase in greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, CFCs, sulphur dioxide, for which we everyone are responsible. 
                 And climate change has affected almost all the natural cycles in Earth like water cycle, carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle etc.</p>
            <p class="answer">
                e.g: due to increase in temperature evaporation of water increases, melting of ice-caps increases which significantly effect water cycle. 
                Now we will study effects in water cycle in detail.</p>
            <p class="answer">  
                As carbon dioxide increases in atmosphere it absorb more heat energy and release less amount than it absorbs due to which temperature increases. 
                According to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (<span style="color: red;">NOAA</span>) CO2 in our atmosphere is about 420 ppb(parts per billion) in today date, 
                which is continuously increasing since 1955. As the observation of NOAA CO2 has increased by 50% i.e. it is 150% CO2 today than that at 1750 A.D.</p>
                
            <p class="answer">
                Geostationary or geosynchronous orbit is the best spot for communications satellites to use, however. This is a zone above Earth's equator at an altitude of 35,786 km (22,236 mi). At this altitude, the rate of "fall" around the Earth is about the same as Earth's rotation, which allows the satellite to stay above the same spot on Earth almost constantly. The satellite thus keeps a perpetual connection with a fixed antenna on the ground, allowing for reliable communications.</p>
                
            <p class="answer">
                While some satellites are best used around the equator, others are better suited to more polar orbits â€” those that circle the Earth from pole to pole so that their coverage zones include the north and south poles. Examples of polar-orbiting satellites include weather satellites and reconnaissance satellites.</p>
